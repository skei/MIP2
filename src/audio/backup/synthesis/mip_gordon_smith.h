  That particular algorithm is known by many names, but I don't think
  "Gordon-Smith" is really that popular. Most of the time (in audio anyway)
  it's just called "modified coupled form." There might have also been some
  other common name that I can't recall right now. In graphics it's also known
  as the magic circle. Other names might be found in other engineering fields.
