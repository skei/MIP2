deprecated...
go here instead: https://github.com/skei/SA_Toolkit


sa_toolkit has evolved and surpassed mip2 in every possible way..
also note that mip2 has stability, performance and portability issues..
so, forget about this, look at sa_toolkit instead!


(maybe i should just delete all the code here, but leave this message and the link..)
