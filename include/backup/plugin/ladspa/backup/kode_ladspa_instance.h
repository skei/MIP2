  /* This member is a function pointer that connects a port on an
     instantiated plugin to a memory location at which a block of data
     for the port will be read/written. The data location is expected
     to be an array of LADSPA_Data for audio ports or a single
     LADSPA_Data value for control ports. Memory issues will be
     managed by the host. The plugin must read/write the data at these
     locations every time run() or run_adding() is called and the data
     present at the time of this connection call should not be
     considered meaningful.

     connect_port() may be called more than once for a plugin instance
     to allow the host to change the buffers that the plugin is
     reading or writing. These calls may be made before or after
     activate() or deactivate() calls.

     connect_port() must be called at least once for each port before
     run() or run_adding() is called. When working with blocks of
     LADSPA_Data the plugin should pay careful attention to the block
     size passed to the run function as the block allocated may only
     just be large enough to contain the block of samples.

     Plugin writers should be aware that the host may elect to use the
     same buffer for more than one port and even use the same buffer
     for both input and output (see LADSPA_PROPERTY_INPLACE_BROKEN).
     However, overlapped buffers or use of a single buffer for both
     audio and control data may result in unexpected behaviour. */

     information dependent on the history of the plugin instance
